# StreamlitFoliumMAPS_Public

This software project uses Python and the Here Platform MAPS API for the geolocation of Guatemalan gas stations. It leverages the Streamlit and Folium libraries for interactive map visualization. It employs data engineering processes for data manipulation and generates a Docker image for container deployment, streamlining execution across various environments. The system intelligently recommends the most profitable gas station based on the product type (Diesel, Regular, Super) as specified in the 'Your Location' option. Additionally, in the 'Radius' option, it searches within a perimeter of 1 to 3 km, depending on the selected parameter.

Inside the repository, you will find a folder named 'images' where you can view some of the step-by-step developments carried out for the implementation of the project.
