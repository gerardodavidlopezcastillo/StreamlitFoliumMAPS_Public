# StreamlitFoliumMAPS_Public

This software project utilizes Python and the Here Platform MAPS API for geolocating Guatemalan gas stations. It incorporates the Streamlit and Folium libraries for interactive map visualization. The project employs data engineering processes to manipulate data and generates a Docker image for container deployment, making execution seamless across different environments. The system intelligently recommends the most profitable gas station based on the type of fuel (Diesel, Regular, Super).

Inside the repository, you will find a folder named 'images' where you can view some of the step-by-step developments carried out for the implementation of the project.
